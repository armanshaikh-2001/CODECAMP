Data Science Projects for CodeCamp Certification

Welcome to the repository for my CodeCamp Data Science Certification projects. This repository includes five diverse projects, each tackling a different aspect of data analysis, cleaning, visualization, and machine learning. The goal is to demonstrate the application of various data science techniques and tools using real-world datasets.

1. Demographic Data Analysis

Objective: Analyze census data from 1994 to understand demographic patterns, including education level, occupation, and income.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Numpy

Skills Demonstrated: Data cleaning, aggregation, and statistical analysis using Pandas.


How to Run:

1. Load the demographic_data.csv file.


2. Use the Jupyter notebook demographic_data_analysis.ipynb to explore various demographic statistics like average age, income level, and work classification.



Key Insights:

Distribution of income based on education level

Gender-based occupational insights



---

2. Medical Data Visualizer

Objective: Visualize medical examination data to uncover relationships between lifestyle choices and cardiac health.

Tools Used: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas

Skills Demonstrated: Data visualization, correlation analysis, and plotting complex multi-variable relationships.


How to Run:

1. Load the medical_data.csv file.


2. Open the Jupyter notebook medical_data_visualizer.ipynb and run the cells to generate visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.).



Key Insights:

Correlation between BMI, cholesterol levels, and heart disease



---

3. Time Series Data Visualization

Objective: Analyze time series data from the FreeCodeCamp forum to detect patterns in page views over time.

Tools Used: Matplotlib, Pandas

Skills Demonstrated: Time series analysis, line chart and bar chart plotting.


How to Run:

1. Load the fcc_page_view_data.csv file.


2. Run the notebook time_series_visualization.ipynb to create line, bar, and box plots.



Key Insights:

Trends in website traffic over the years

Monthly and yearly page view comparisons



---

4. Sea Level Predictor

Objective: Predict future sea levels based on historical data from 1880 to present.

Tools Used: Python, Matplotlib, Linear Regression

Skills Demonstrated: Linear regression, extrapolation, and future prediction using historical data.


How to Run:

1. Load the epa-sea-level.csv file.


2. Use the Jupyter notebook sea_level_predictor.ipynb to visualize the past sea level rise and predict future trends through 2050.



Key Insights:

Visualization of rising sea levels

Projection of future levels and potential environmental impact



---

5. Global Temperature Trends Analysis

Objective: Analyze global temperature trends and compare regional temperature variations over time.

Tools Used: Pandas, Matplotlib

Skills Demonstrated: Global temperature data analysis, trend detection, and visualization.


How to Run:

1. Load the global_temperature.csv file.


2. Run the notebook global_temperature_analysis.ipynb to analyze global temperature trends and generate comparative graphs.



Key Insights:

Increase in global temperatures over the past century

Comparison of temperature changes across different regions
